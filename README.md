Overview
This Rock-Paper-Scissors project is part of The Odin Project roadmap. The main goal of this project was to enhance my skills and ensure better and more efficient practices for future projects.

Features
BEM Methodology:

The HTML and CSS are structured using the principles of BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology. This approach ensures a clear structure and enhances the readability of the code.
DRY Principles:

In the JavaScript code, I applied the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles wherever applicable. While there were instances where I could have further optimized the code using DRY principles, I chose to maintain clarity, especially regarding the usage of localStorage. My focus was on keeping the code clean and understandable.

LocalStorage:

One of the standout features is the integration of localStorage, which allows the user to retain gameplay statistics even after exiting or refreshing the page.
Each game is stored in an array of objects, from which I create statistics that provide insights into estimated wins and details about the last round.
This ensures a seamless user experience as users can view their statistics at any time.
Mini Statistics:

The sidebar displays mini statistics of the gameplay, allowing users to quickly assess their performance. This includes estimated wins and scores from the last round.

Session Management:

Users can easily delete their session data through an intuitive interface. Clicking on the delete session icon triggers a popup with options, preventing accidental deletions of localStorage. This adds an extra layer of user protection and enhances the overall user experience.
Conclusion
This project not only solidified my understanding of web development principles but also emphasized the importance of clean code, usability, and data persistence. By utilizing methodologies like BEM and DRY, I aimed to create a robust, maintainable, and user-friendly application.
